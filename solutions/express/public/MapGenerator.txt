You are generating a high-level layout for a fantasy game map using region-based definitions instead of full tile grids.

The total map size is 100x100 tiles.

Use a **region-based structure** to define areas of the map. Each region must include:

- `name`: A descriptive name for the zone (e.g. "outer_forest", "village_market", "pier_docks")
- `position`: Top-left `[x, y]` of the region
- `size`: Width and height `[w, h]`
- `type`: One of: `castle`, `village`, `market`, `forest`, `lake`, `river`, `snow`, `cliff`, `pier`, `plains`, etc.
- `fill`: (optional) Base tile (`base`) and optional `features` with density (0.0â€“1.0)
- `walls`: (optional) Tile symbol for solid wall around the region
- `boundary`: (optional) Tile symbol for outer buffer area (e.g., castle courtyard)
- `interior`: (optional) Anchored props like beds, doors, chests, paths
- `anchors`: (optional) Player start, pier ends, etc.

Tile symbols (1-character codes):
. = unused  
g = ground  
r = rock  
R = high rock (boundary)  
w = wall  
b = wall boundary  
~ = water  
s = snow  
S = snow cliff  
o = snow rock  
d = door  
t = tree  
T = tall tree  
x = bed  
m = market stall  
f = fence  
p = path  
c = chest  

The map must **make logical sense** as a game world. Follow these guidelines:

- A **castle** should be in a central or strategic area, possibly with a wall (`w`) and gate (`d`)
- A **village** should surround or be near the castle, with homes, a **market**, and roads (`p`)
- A **pier** should be on a lake or river near the village
- **Forests** or **cliffs** should form the outer edges or transitions between biomes
- Use **features** (trees, rocks, stalls, paths) with appropriate density (e.g., trees in forests, paths in villages)
- Include some **manual placements** in interiors (e.g., beds in houses, market stalls, doors in walls)
- Each area should be **non-square**, unless a structure like a castle

Output the map in this JSON-like structure only. Do not include explanations or full tilemaps.
