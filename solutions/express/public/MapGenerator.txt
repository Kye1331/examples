Generate a detailed 100x100 tile-based fantasy game map using the tile codes below. Each tile represents a game environment feature and should be used strategically to create a realistic, explorable world. The map should be playable and designed for player movement, exploration, and gameplay variety.

Tile Codes (Environment Key):

yaml

00 : nothing (not on map / out-of-bounds)
01 : ground (normal terrain)
02 : rock (small boulders)
03 : high rock / cliff (impassable boundary)
04 : wall (castle/building wall)
05 : wall boundary (castle/city limits)
06 : water (lake, river)
07 : snowy ground
08 : snowy wall boundary (impassable)
09 : snowy rock
10 : door
11 : tree
12 : tall tree
13 : bed
14 : sand
15 : desert rock
16 : bridge
17 : wooden floor
18 : grass (lush, walkable)
19 : flower patch
20 : lava
21 : lava rock
22 : cave entrance
23 : campfire
24 : tent
25 : farm field (crop)
26 : fence
27 : stone path
28 : market stall
29 : fountain
30 : throne
ðŸ§  Map Logic Guidelines:
Design functional zones: Include distinct areas like:

Forest biome (use 11, 12, 18, 19)

Snow biome (use 07, 08, 09)

Desert biome (use 14, 15, 20, 21)

Castle/City (use 04, 05, 10, 13, 17, 30)

Plains (01, 18, 27)

Lake or river system (06 with bridges 16)

Village/town (use 17, 28, 29, 25, 26)

Cave or dungeon entrances (22, surrounded by 02, 03)

Biome transitions should be gradual, using border tiles or mix-ins (e.g., 18 into 07, or 14 into 01).

Avoid square shapes in natural zones (e.g., forests, lakes) to simulate realism. Only man-made structures (e.g., castles, towns) should be rectangular or organized.

The map should include paths (27) connecting areas like:

Forest â†’ Village â†’ Castle

Castle â†’ Dungeon â†’ Snow area

Town â†’ Desert â†’ River

Include gameplay-relevant structures:

A central castle or fortress

A small forest camp with tent (24) and campfire (23)

At least one village or town square with stalls (28), fountain (29), and housing

A farming area (25, 26)

Optional secret cave with lava pool entrance (22, 20)

Start the map output immediately.

Only output the tile map in plain text, one row per line.

Do not explain the map.

Do not wrap it in code blocks or Markdown.
